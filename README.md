## API
The api will be hosted [here](https://api2.sanic.ca)  
The docs are [here](/docs)

## Tech Stack / Requirements
- MongoDB instance (if you don't have one check out [mlab's](https://mlab.com) free 500mb sandbox instances)
- Node.js && Express

## Front End
The example app front-end is hosted [here](https://url.sanic.ca) and src [here](/public). If you want to host a front-end on a different server there is some front-end code [here](https://github.com/persa188/url-shortener-frontend) that points to the default example api.

### TODO:
- [x] remove /public and update code accordingly  (already done on production server)
- [ ] automate production server updates
- [x] add a Dockerfile to make intializing in a docker container ezpz
- [x] move production server code from temporary screen to docker container
- [x] docs
- [ ] update this list with more tasks as they become apparent (ongoing)
- [x] change ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¯.ws to cloudlfare in order to hide origin server IP
- [ ] make conf.js generic and configure to not overwrite local conf.js versions
- [ ] Make this Repository Public (after removing identifying information)
- [x] remove hardcoded ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¯.ws on client code and change to a window.location.href.host with checks against an alias list.
